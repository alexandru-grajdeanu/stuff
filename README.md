## Description

![](dinopass.gif)

DinoPass was first created to satisfy my own needs. Because I tend to change my 
passwords pretty frequently I usually find myself in a position of having to reset 
them kinda often. So there's that. 


## How it works and what it does

Everything is meant to be as easy and intuitive as possible. You're going to be asked
for a master password which is going to be the only one that you'll need to remember
(so please make sure it's gonna be as strong as possible!). After you'll enter your
master password these are all the options that are currently available:

* List all your passwords  (WARNING: It's going to be in clear text!)
* Purge all your passwords (WARNING: This is permanent so do it at your own risk!)
* Create a new password
* Update an existing password
* Retrieve an existing password (by name)
* Delete an existing password


## Installation

Installing DinoPass is as simple as:

```shell script
python3.10 setup.py install
```

## Usage

You can always check the help menu by running:

```shell script
dinopass --help

Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  DinoPass - Simple CLI Password manager

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  all              List all credentials (this command does not have...
  create           Create a new password with a specific name.
  delete           Delete a specific credential by name.
  get              Get a specific credential by name.
  purge            Purge all credentials.
  update-name      Update password name.
  update-password  Update password value.

All the arguments are mutually exclusive
```

## TO DO

* Add type annotations
* Add tests
* Improve readme (add installation process, how the passwords are stored, etc)
* Implement functionality of saving the password to clipboard instead
of printing it.
